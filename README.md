Data Science final project

## Question to address: 
Can the likelihood a flight is delayed be predicted? This involves developing a predictive model that can estimate the probability of a flight being delayed based on various factors such as the date of the flight, airline identifier, starting and destination airport codes, planned and actual departure and arrival times, and other relevant features.

## Why it is interesting: 
Flight delays are a significant inconvenience for passengers and a costly issue for airlines. Predicting the likelihood of delays will help airlines better manage their schedules, optimize resource allocation, and improve customer satisfaction. Passengers, on the other hand, can use this information to make more informed travel decisions. The ability to predict delays can also help in identifying systemic issues within the aviation system, potentially leading to more efficient and reliable air travel.
Additionally, we have curiosities as to which factors play the largest role in delays. Obviously, weather has an immediate effect on a flight schedule. However, when flights are normally delayed, is this affected by the length of the flight? The airline? The airport? These are some questions we look to answer.
